# closetly

Closetly is a virtual closet app that allows users to add pictures of their clothes and descriptions to easily organize their closet. This project is
my first full-stack web application and also utilizes a machine learning model I created using tensorflow and keras. This model is used to classify the images the user uploads to their closet and allow them to toggle between viewing their entire closet, only tops, only bottoms, or only shoes.
