# closetly

Closetly is a virtual closet app that allows users to add pictures of their clothes and descriptions to easily organize their closet. This project is
my first full-stack web application and also utilizes a machine learning model I created using Tensorflow and Keras. This model is used to classify the images the user uploads to their closet and allow them to toggle between viewing their entire closet, only tops, only bottoms, or only shoes.

- **Amazon AWS**  
  Used to create and manage an Elastic Container Service (ECS) to deploy the FastAPI application.

- **TensorFlow**  
  The library used for creating and training the image classification model. 

- **Keras**  
  Utilized Kerasâ€™s categorical API to design, train, and test a neural network model.

- **Docker**  
  Used to containerize the machine learning API and deploy it to Amazon AWS. 

- **Axios**  
  Used for making HTTP queries to the MySQL database and interacting with the machine learning API.

- **Express**  
  A web framework used for handling HTTP requests to the MySQL database. 

- **Node.js**  
  The runtime environment used to build the backend of the application.
